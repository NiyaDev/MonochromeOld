# Monochrome
### Language: Assembly


A complete reinvention of early Pokemon in feeling, tone, and look. While giving it a completely new battle system to remove some of my personal gripes with the series.

The new system is action based where you act as the pokemon in an open arena and your attacks can both act as offensive actions but also as defensive by changing the terrain, zoning the enemy, or moving your character in interesting ways.
